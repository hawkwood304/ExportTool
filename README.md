This is a customize tool I create for animost studio. It's use to export all object rig and camera to fbx. So the data can be transfer into UE for rendering.
In this project I use python 3. So if you want to check out this you need to use Maya 2022+ with python 3. And you need to install pyside2 too.
How to use:
1. Copy the file to you current maya script folder
2. Open script editor in Maya, chose Python language
3. Copy and pasted:
import ExportTool
ExportTool.MainWindow().show()
4. Hit enter then walla you had it.
Good luck. I wish this will come handy to you.
